This project explains how Observer - Design Pattern works. 

Observer patterns defines one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents(objects) are notified and updated automatically.

For Example: Slack: When one person send message to group, it is broadcasted to all other registered users in the group automatically. 
Other examples: When the stock price for Apple, Micosoft or other companies changes, applicaton made with the use of Observer pattern can send notifications to the all the registered email(subscribers) automatically.


Please feel free if you want to add something to it or want further clarification. 

Thank you
